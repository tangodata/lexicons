  term: 8 COUNT BASIC
  term2: Basico, Academic Basic
  definition: >
    The first figure usually taught to beginning students after the walking steps.
    The 8 count basic includes elements which are used throughout the dance,
    although the complete figure itself is not much used socially.
    The name refers to counts in music, however, the man is not constrained to
    rigidly mark a step on each count or beat of the rhythm.
    He is free to hold or to syncopate, or cut the beat, as the music moves
    him or as space on the floor around him allows.
    Also the figure may be danced into or out of at various points and is
    not always entered at the beginning.
    There are also shortcuts within the 8 count basic.
    For instance, the man may lead the lady from the cruzada at
    5 directly to 2, or he may close his left foot to his right without
    weight on 7 and step side left directly to 2.
    So in actuality the positions which the dancers move through at each step
    are numbered as reference points.
    In closed dance position, they are as follows;
    * The man steps back right, the lady forward left. Or, variations:
    the man settles his weight on his right leg, placing the lady on her
    left, and holds.
    Also, the man may settle on his right leg, placing the lady on her left,
    quickly extending his left leg to his left side to point then
    closing back to his right leg without weight, as the lady mirrors
    his action with her right leg. Or the man may step through with his
    right leg between the partners, leading the lady to mirror his
    action (espejo) by stepping through with her left leg,
    remaining in closed position although briefly resembling
    promenade position.

    The man steps side left, the lady side right, with the man stepping slightly further than the lady.
    The man steps forward right in outside right position keeping his upper body turned toward the lady in contra-body, the lady back left paralleling the man and also in contra-body. This is a common point of entry to the figure which the ladies should be aware of.
    The man steps forward left, the lady back right stretching slightly more and seeking the man�s center.
    The man closes his right foot to his left with weight and rotates his upper body to face forward, leading the lady to cross her left foot in front of her right with weight (cruzada) as she finishes moving back in front of the man. Many variations for the lady begin from this position.
    The man steps forward left inside his partner (to her center), the lady back right.
    The man steps side right, the lady side left.
    The man closes his left foot to his right with weight, the lady her right foot to her left.

    Steps 1 through 3 (sometimes 1 through 5) are known as the salida.
    Steps 3 through 5 are known as "walking the lady to the cross".
    Steps 6 through 8 are known as [resolucion].

  term: ABRAZO
  definition: >
    Dance hold.

  extended: >
    In Milonguero style, and Salon style.
    Close body contact. The women’s arm is around the shoulders of the man
    or behind the man’s back.
    In  Salon Style the embrace can open slightly to accommodate more complex moves.
    The weight is on the balls of the feet for both the man and the woman.
    The upper bodies being closer to each other than the feet, is part of
    close embrace for Salon style.
    The woman and the man have their own axis and share a common third axis
    in between the contact of their bodies.
    In milonguero style the woman’s body leans forward on the man’s to
    produce very close body contact. The embrace does not change throughout
    the dance. The woman’s head is turned to the left.
    The woman’s axis is often very forward onto the man’s and is
    no longer her own.
    Open embrace: used in Nuevo tango.
    No body contact, very loose informal open arms.

    Sometimes spelled [Voleo].
    Is a movement which appears to throw the working leg in a circular motion.
    For example, a back boleo can be executed by pivoting the supporting leg
    (say R) one direction (CCW) while extended the working foot (L) back,
    then quickly changing directions, pivoting CW on the standing leg (R)
    before the working foot has completed the extension back.
    This creates its characteristic whip effect.
    If the working foot is lifted during the pivot CW, this is considered a
    high boleo which adds to the appearance of a circular motion.
    A front boleo can be executed by pivoting the supporting leg (say R)
    one direction (CW) while extended the working foot (L) front, then
    quickly changing directions pivoting CCW on the standing leg (R),
    while lifting the L foot during the pivot.
    To execute the front and back boleo's simultaneously, it is necessary

  definition: >

    The cabeceo makes the invitation to dance less stressful as it allows
    the invited person to decline discretely.
    Non-verbal cues are frequently used.
    So, as you are getting ready to ask someone to dance, try to catch
    their eye, smile and nod.
    You might raise your eyebrows in an inquiring expression or directing
    a nod towards the dance floor.
    Observe their body language. For instance, if you make eye-contact
    and the other person quickly turns away, pretends not to see you,
    or busies themselves in some way, it means they do not want to dance.
    On the other hand, if your potential partner returns your eye-contact
    with a smile and/or a nod, you are encouraged to invite them
    verbally (ie. "would you like to dance?").
    When inviting a person who is in the presence of their significant
    other, it is courteous to ask their significant other for permission.
    Be friendly but not flirtatious and avoid dance moves that are
    sexually suggestive.

    particular method of turning for the leader in which he pivots
    both feet CW (or both feet CCW) at the same time.
    For a 90 degree turn, he begins in parada position and
    pivots until he stands straight with both feet apart
    (or vice versa: start standing, end in parada position).
    For a 180 turn, he begins in parada position, reaches
    standing position at 90 degrees but continues turning until
    he is once again in the parada position.
    Frequently accompanies the woman's molinete, this effect
    creates an interesting cadence in her movement

    to the left on his left foot, stepping side right and drawing his
    left foot under him with weight (as the lady dances the natural opposite).
    The man returns to outside right position and either continues the
    figure or walks the lady to the cross.

-
  term: CAMINAR
  definition: >
    To walk:
    The walk is similar to a natural walking step, but
    placing the ball of the foot first instead of the heel.
    Sometimes taught that the body and leg must move as a unit so that the
    body is in balance over the forward foot.
    Another style requires stretching the working leg, placing the foot,
    and then taking the body over the new supporting foot regardless
    of direction.
    Walks should be practiced both forward and backward for balance, fluidity,
    and cat like gracefulness.

  definition: >
    The Spanish slang of the Buenos Aires underworld which is common in
    tango lyrics and terminology.
  extended: >
    The same way as lawyers, doctors, physicists, chemists, etc. have their
    peculiar language and terminology, thieves needed a language that was
    cryptic, secretive enough to speak among themselves and at the same
    time was unintelligible for the police or the possible victim of their
    actions.
    A language to be used in prison that could not be understood by the guards.
    This originated terms and expressions that formed a new language, that
    of thieves and jail inmates.
    The secret tongue of "lunfardos", term used by thieves to refer to
    themselves.
    In this way watch became "bobo" (dumb-stupid) due to two characteristics,
    it is very easy to steal and it works all day long non-stop.
    Lunfardo is rich in Italian dialectal terms and also French words.
    The first manifestations of this language appeared in Buenos Aires
    around 1880 ( police and newspapers archives).
    This new terminology invaded the familiar language of the
    [conventillos] dwellers and very slowly the language of men
    (it was not used at home or by women), finally became something
    characteristic of being Porteño and Argentine.
    It was spread by theater in its "Sainetes", a peculiar genre
    that depicts life in [conventillos]; it was used by poets;
    but the greatest means of diffusion was not literature but
    its use in Tango Lyrics.

    such as the two and four beats of swing music rather than the more common accent on the
    one and three beats.
    Dancers have come to use the term to describe cutting the beat, or stepping on

    Stage Tango
    This is a hybrid tango, an amalgam of traditional tango steps, ballet,

    of every kind, sentadas, kicks, leaps, spins, lifts, and anything else
    that the choreographer and the performers think that they can get away with.
    Alas, this style of dancing shows up from time to time at the milongas, usually
    badly performed by ill-behaved tango dancers and frustrated tango performers
    who insist on getting their money's worth even if they have to kick, step on,
    bump into, or trip every other dancer on the floor.
    This behavior is NOT socially acceptable.

    (very few milongueros would be referred to as tangueros).

    such as stage dancers, who are quite disdained by real milongueros and tangueros,
    unless they go the extra distance and become milongueros by going to the milongas,
    and/or tangueros as well. An aficionado.
