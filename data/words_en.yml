  term: 8 COUNT BASIC 
  definition: >
    The first figure usually taught to beginning students after the walking steps. 
    The 8 count basic includes elements which are used throughout the dance, 
    although the complete figure itself is not much used socially.
    The name refers to counts in music, however, the man is not constrained to 
    rigidly mark a step on each count or beat of the rhythm. 
    He is free to hold or to syncopate, or cut the beat, as the music moves 
    him or as space on the floor around him allows. 
    Also the figure may be danced into or out of at various points and is 
    not always entered at the beginning. 
    There are also shortcuts within the 8 count basic. 
    For instance, the man may lead the lady from the cruzada at 
    5 directly to 2, or he may close his left foot to his right without 
    weight on 7 and step side left directly to 2. 
    So in actuality the positions which the dancers move through at each step 
    are numbered as reference points. 
    In closed dance position, they are as follows;
    * The man steps back right, the lady forward left. Or, variations: 
    the man settles his weight on his right leg, placing the lady on her 
    left, and holds. 
    Also, the man may settle on his right leg, placing the lady on her left, 
    quickly extending his left leg to his left side to point then 
    closing back to his right leg without weight, as the lady mirrors 
    his action with her right leg. Or the man may step through with his 
    right leg between the partners, leading the lady to mirror his 
    action (espejo) by stepping through with her left leg, 
    remaining in closed position although briefly resembling 
    promenade position.
    
    The man steps side left, the lady side right, with the man stepping slightly further than the lady.
    The man steps forward right in outside right position keeping his upper body turned toward the lady in contra-body, the lady back left paralleling the man and also in contra-body. This is a common point of entry to the figure which the ladies should be aware of.
    The man steps forward left, the lady back right stretching slightly more and seeking the manï¿½s center.
    The man closes his right foot to his left with weight and rotates his upper body to face forward, leading the lady to cross her left foot in front of her right with weight (cruzada) as she finishes moving back in front of the man. Many variations for the lady begin from this position.
    The man steps forward left inside his partner (to her center), the lady back right.
    The man steps side right, the lady side left.
    The man closes his left foot to his right with weight, the lady her right foot to her left.
    
    Steps 1 through 3 (sometimes 1 through 5) are known as the salida. 
    Steps 3 through 5 are known as "walking the lady to the cross". 
    Steps 6 through 8 are known as [resolucion].

    dancing was judged by the figure she left behind in the dirt after she danced away.

    badly performed by ill-behaved tango dancers and frustrated tango performers 
    who insist on getting their money's worth even if they have to kick, step on, 
    bump into, or trip every other dancer on the floor.

    And of course one can be an extremely good tango dancer without being either, 
    such as stage dancers, who are quite disdained by real milongueros and tangueros, 
    unless they go the extra distance and become milongueros by going to the milongas,
