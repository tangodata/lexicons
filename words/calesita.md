Carousel; the merry-go-round

A figure in which the man places the lady on one foot with
a lifting action of his frame and then dances around her
while keeping her centered over, and pivoting on, her
supporting leg.

Sometimes referred to as the [Stork].

A movement in which the man leans the lady's axis on his and
steps around her placing all his steps equidistant to her
supporting leg.

If he steps further away from her supporting leg during the
calesita it creates a deeper angle and is often called
Carpa (tent).
