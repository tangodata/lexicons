From amagar - To make a threatening motion as a feint

An amague is used as an embellishment either led or done on
one's own, and may be used before taking a step.
An example of an amague may be a beat ([frappe]) before
taking a step.

Sometimes called a [Saludo], it is a woman's embellishment
similar to a 'frappe' (beating motion) in ballet.
It involves quickly crossing one leg in front of, or
behind the other, before taking a step.
