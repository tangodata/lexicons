Change of Front.

Simply involves facing a new direction.
However, some teachers use the term to specifically refer to a
particular method of turning for the leader in which he pivots
both feet CW (or both feet CCW) at the same time.

For a 90 degree turn, he begins in parada position and
pivots until he stands straight with both feet apart
(or vice versa start standing, end in parada position).

For a 180 turn, he begins in parada position, reaches
standing position at 90 degrees but continues turning until
he is once again in the parada position.

Frequently accompanies the woman's molinete, this effect
creates an interesting cadence in her movement
