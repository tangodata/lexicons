From cabeza; head

Traditional technique for selecting dance partners from a
distance at the milongas in Buenos Aires,
by using eye contact and head movements.

The cabeceo makes the invitation to dance less stressful as
it allows the invited person to decline discretely.

Non-verbal cues are frequently used.

So, as you are getting ready to ask someone to dance,
try to catch their eye, smile and nod.

You might raise your eyebrows in an inquiring expression or
directing a nod towards the dance floor.

Observe their body language. For instance, if you make
eye-contact and the other person quickly turns away,
pretends not to see you, or busies themselves in some way,
it means they do not want to dance.

On the other hand, if your potential partner returns
your eye-contact with a smile and / or a nod, you are
encouraged to invite them verbally
(ie. "would you like to dance?").

When inviting a person who is in the presence of their
significant other, it is courteous to ask their
significant other for permission.

Be friendly but not flirtatious and avoid dance moves that
are sexually suggestive.

Avoid monopolizing anyoneâ€™s partner with multiple [tandas]
