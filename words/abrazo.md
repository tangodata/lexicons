The embrace; a hug; or dance position.

In Milonguero style, and Salon style.

Close body contact. The women’s arm is around the shoulders of the man or behind the man’s back.

In  Salon Style the embrace can open slightly to accommodate more complex moves.

The weight is on the balls of the feet for both the man and
the woman.

The upper bodies being closer to each other than the feet,
is part of close embrace for Salon style.

The woman and the man have their own axis and share a
common third axis in between the contact of their bodies.

In milonguero style the woman’s body leans forward on the
man’s to produce very close body contact.
The embrace does not change throughout the dance.
The woman’s head is turned to the left.
The woman’s axis is often very forward onto the man’s and is
no longer her own.

Open embrace  used in Nuevo tango.
No body contact, very loose informal open arms.
The women’s left hand is holding the man’s arm at or above
the elbow.
