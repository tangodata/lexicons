From bolear - To throw

A boleo may be executed either high or low.

Keeping the knees together, with one leg back, swivel and
return on the supporting leg with a whipping action of
the working leg.

Sometimes spelled [Voleo].

Is a movement which appears to throw the working leg in
a circular motion.
For example, a back boleo can be executed by pivoting
the supporting leg (say R) one direction (CCW) while
extended the working foot (L) back, then quickly
changing directions, pivoting CW on the standing leg
(R) before the working foot has completed the extension back.
This creates its characteristic whip effect.

If the working foot is lifted during the pivot CW, this
is considered a high boleo which adds to the appearance of
a circular motion.

A front boleo can be executed by pivoting the supporting
leg (say R) one direction (CW) while extended the working
foot (L) front, then quickly changing directions pivoting
CCW on the standing leg (R), while lifting the L foot
during the pivot.

To execute the front and back boleo's simultaneously,
it is necessary to join the feet immediately after each boleo.
