A very old style of tango from the 1900s to the 1940s.

The music from this era had a faster or peppier 2/4 tempo so the
dance had a rhythmic flavor similar to that of modern milonga.
A very close embrace was used as well as some unique posture and
footwork elements.

The tango of the [arrabal].

A lunfardo word with several meanings; It refers to somebody or
something from the slums, i.e. low class.

It also describes a gathering where people from the slums dance.

slum attitude.

Finally, it is a rhythmic effect created by Leopoldo Thompson
by hitting the string of the contrabass with the hand or
the arch of the bow.
